# Lyric-Scrapper

Here is the readme [readme](https://github.com/Trodrigs1120/Lyric-Scrapper/blob/master/Readme.pdf) pdf that I made 

The script will need to be rune in Node. It prompts you to pick an artist, verify that the artist selected is correct and then the scrape begins.
For a quick walkthrough and example, see the pdf link above.
Please note you will need to insert a Last fm api key in order for the script to work.
